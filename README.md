# Title: Music Analysis Database: Exploring Music Sales and Customer Trends

Description:
The "Music Analysis" database is a comprehensive project designed to analyze and understand various aspects of a music store's operations. This project incorporates a well-structured database schema, comprising multiple tables that store relevant information about albums, artists, customers, employees, genres, invoices, media types, playlists, tracks, and their relationships.

The main objective of this project is to enable efficient querying and retrieval of data based on specific client requirements. Let's explore some of the questions that can be answered using this database:

Question Set 1 -

(1)Write a query to return the email, first name, last name, and genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return the list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A.
--This query retrieves the contact information (email, first name, last name) and preferred genre of customers who listen to rock music. The results are ordered alphabetically by email.

(2)Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.
--By identifying the artists who have written the most rock music tracks and selecting the top 10 based on the track count, this query provides a list of rock bands that have a significant presence in the dataset.

(3)Return all track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. Return the name and milliseconds for each track, ordered by the song length with the longest songs listed first.
--This query retrieves track names and their respective lengths (in milliseconds) for all tracks that have a duration longer than the average song length. The results are ordered by song length, with the longest songs listed first.

Question Set 2 -

(1)Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
--This query identifies the employee with the highest employee ID within each job title category, determining the most senior employee based on job title.

(2)Which countries have the most invoices?
--By grouping invoices based on billing country and counting the number of invoices in each country, this query determines the countries with the highest number of invoices.

(3)What are the top 3 values of total invoice?
--This query retrieves the top three values of the total invoice amount, allowing for an understanding of the highest revenue-generating invoices.

(4)Which city has the best customers?
--By summing the total invoice amounts for each city and identifying the city with the highest sum, this query determines the city with the most lucrative customer base. This information can help identify potential locations for promotional events, such as a Music Festival.

(5)Who is the best customer?
--This query identifies the customer who has spent the most money. By calculating the total amount spent by each customer and selecting the customer with the highest spending, the query determines the "best" customer in terms of their monetary contribution to the store.
